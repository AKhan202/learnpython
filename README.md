Learn Python
========

This repository was created for educational purposes. If you'd like to share a project that would help others learn Python please leave a comment or a pull request. Thank you! :)

You are welcome to fork this repo and add your projects to it as well.

In this README file I will link each project that I finish. Projects that share some common properties (eg. They all about numbers) will be in the same folder.

===============================

First Programs
---------

In this folder you will find the most basic programs written in Python. If you just started learning the language this is the place to start.

[**Hello, World Program**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/First_programs/helloworld.py)

Numbers
---------

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. No limit to the number of decimals

[**Fibonacci Value**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_value.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate its Fibonacci value.

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number.

[**Calculator**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/calc.py) - A simple calculator to do the 4 basic operations (Later make it scientific).
